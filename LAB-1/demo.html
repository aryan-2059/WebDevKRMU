        <p>Hey there! I'm Aryan, currently pursuing a BTech with specialization in 
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I aim at combining strong coding fundamentals 
        with creative problem-solving to take up challenges in tech.<br>
    To the table, I bring 2 years' of hands-on experience each in Java, Python and MySQL, having built a solid foundation in 
    logical and algorithmic thinking through school framework, courses, projects and numerous coding exercises.<br>
Alongside these languages, I have explored JavaScript and built some projects, aimed at pushing my skills further down the tech path. 
Driven by a genuine interest in the field of technology, I hope to someday create a machine that doesn't just solve complex problems, but also figures out why code chooses to misbehave sometimes.
If you're open to collaborate, exchange ideas, or just connect with someone enthusiastic about tech and more, feel free to reach out. </p>
